Astrology and stargazing are my hobbies. I'm drawn to exploring unconventional branches of astrology.

My main areas of interests are <span style="color:#51AD36"> western sidereal</span> astrology, <span style="color:#F08650"> constellational (true sidereal)</span> astrology, <span style="color:#1393F2"> Babylonian</span> astrology, and <span style="color:#D151B6"> cosmobiology</span>.

I was disappointed with popular Western astrology when I realized that its tropical zodiac is not related to the stars at all. I decided to work with <span style="color:#D151B6"> sidereal zodiac (Fagan-Bradley)</span>, and <span style="color:#1393F2"> constellations (13+ zodiacs)</span>. Although still quite symbolic, they are more closely related to the <span style="color:#51AD36"> fixed stars</span>. To me, the influence of the real stars is more probable than that of the tropical zodiac.

I do not use any house system. I find their foundations questionable. Discovering astrologers who do not use houses encouraged me to abandon the concept of houses for good, and focus on planetary dynamics and stellar influences.
